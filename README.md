# ⛰️ Oneblock Ultimate

**The ultimate version of the Oneblock Minecraft gamemode.**

<details>
  <summary>Special Thanks</summary>

  I want to give special credit to [BPR02](https://github.com/BPR02) — the creator of the [Vanilla One Block](https://modrinth.com/datapack/vanilla-one-block) datapack that inspired this project. His work helped shape the foundation of this datapack.  
  Thank you! ❤️

</details>

Start with a single block, expand your world, explore new biomes and dimensions, and collect every block in the game! 🌍  

This datapack adds **extra features** that allow you to **beat the game** and obtain **every single obtainable item**.  
But... *how is this possible?* 🤔

By adding **special (and challenging) mechanics, recipes, drops and trades**, you’ll be able to acquire every unique and normally unobtainable item in Vanilla Minecraft.

## ⚙️ Mechanics

### 🔥 Lava

You can obtain **lava** similarly to how you obtain clay from mud and pointed dripstone: 

- Place an **empty cauldron** below a **pointed dripstone**.  
- Place a **magma block two blocks above** the dripstone.  
- **Over time** (and with the player nearby), the magma blocks will randomly transform into **netherrack**, and the **cauldron below** will fill with **lava**.

<p align="center"><img src="images/mechanics/magma_to_netherrack.png" alt="Magma Block to Netherrack" width="256"></p>
⚠️ Only work's in the nether

### 🐷 Curing Piglin Zombification

You can **cure a zombified piglin** similarly to how you cure a zombie villager:

1. <img src="images/items/Weakness_JE3_BE2.png" width="24"> Apply **Weakness** to the **Zombified Piglin**.  
2. <img src="images/items/Invicon_Golden_Carrot.png" width="24"> Drop a **Golden Carrot** near it and wait for it to pick it up.  
3. ⏳ Wait about **30 seconds** for the curing process to finish.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:12px;">

  <img src="images/mechanics/arrow.png" style="height:64; display:block;">
  <img src="images/mobs/150px-Piglin_JE1.png" width="128">
</div>

✅ You can do this in any dimension. 

⚠️ However, **piglins outside the Nether** don’t last long before turning back into zombified piglins.


### 🗝️ Resetting Trial Chamber Vaults

You can reset trial chamber vaults simply by standing directly above them.
This causes the vault to return to its unopened state, allowing you to use keys on it again.

✅ Lets you repeat vault rewards as needed. 

⚠️ Ensure your player hitbox is positioned directly over the vault for the reset to trigger.

## 🛠️ Starter Help

This package includes the starter help from Vanilla One Block to speed up the initial grind.
The following features will apply until a player obtains an iron shovel.

- Over 80% of hostile mobs that spawn will be zombies.
- All zombies will spawn with iron shovels, which will have a 80% chance of dropping with at least 25% durability left (63/250).
- Jumping will cause the player to gain the Hunger effect (unless there's a zombie in the world).
- Players will be reduced to 4 hearts when starving (initial starving damage deals 6 hearts instead of half a heart of damage).
- Players will have full knockback resistance.
- Daytime will be skipped (unless there's a zombie in the world).
- Once the shovel is obtained, it will continuously rain until 23 snow blocks are placed down.

## 💡 Additional Features
